# Monte Carlo Methods in Radiation Oncology

## Overview
This repo stores my research and progress on exploring Monte Carlo methods in high-energy physics for use in medical physics settings. Ideally I would love to create some of my own models for medical physics and modeling how particles interact with tissue and cells. 

## Project Motivation
Having worked in a radiation oncology lab for several years, once I started getting my computer science degree I knew I wanted to pursue the computational physics side of the subject. I like nuclear physics, and I'm excited to research it through a new perspective!

## Goals
I would like to create a baby version of a software that would model dose deposition easily and quickly. However, I know that's a big goal that will take a lot of time, so here are my sub-goals:
- Learn more about the use of monte carlo simulations in high energy physics
- Understand Industry standards for use of monte carlo simulations and become familiar with common tools and packages. 

## Progress Updates:
### February 18th 2025: 
This Repo was created and I started finding references to list in the references document
